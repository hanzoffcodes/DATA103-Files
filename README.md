# DATA103-Portfolio
Compilation of all my DATA103 outputs

**Project 1:** [Python Refresher](https://github.com/hanzoffcodes/DATA103-Portfolio/tree/main/Python%20Refresher)
</br>
  In this project, we were tasked to explore and implement various machine learning concepts, including classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing. Using Python, we created a notebook with sections dedicated to each topic, ran example codes, and customized them based on specific requirements.
