# DATA103-Portfolio
Compilation of all my DATA103 outputs

**Project 1:** [Python Refresher](https://github.com/hanzoffcodes/DATA103-Portfolio/tree/main/Python%20Refresher)
</br>
  In this project, we were tasked to explore and implement various machine learning concepts, including classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing. Using Python, we created a notebook with sections dedicated to each topic, ran example codes, and customized them based on specific requirements.

Project 2: [KNN](https://github.com/hanzoffcodes/DATA103-Portfolio/tree/main/KNN%20Classifier)
</br>
  In this project, we were tasked to run and explore a Jupyter Notebook focused on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The activity involved adjusting hyperparameters and experimenting with various configurations of the libraries used

</br>

Project 3: [Data Handling and Feature Selection](https://github.com/hanzoffcodes/DATA103-Portfolio/tree/main/Feature%20Selection%20and%20Data%20Handling)
</br>
  In this project, we were tasked to perform data handling and feature selection on an MBA dataset to identify patterns and key attributes of admitted students. This involved cleaning the dataset, addressing any missing or inconsistent values, and selecting the most relevant features that influence admission decisions
